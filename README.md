the world's worst dialogue editor

This project started out as an experiment with Godot's UI system that went way too far. Initially, this was going to be a 2D level editor with a dialogue editor as a "bonus feature"; thus, the codebase (as well as platform of choice) carries many remnants of that fact. As the development of this project was primarily a learning experience, code quality ranges from questionable to violating the Geneva Conventions. The code for this project was made up of so much spaghetti that Benito Mussolini tried to impose increased import tariffs on it. It's horrible, but somehow still works *way* better than it has any right to.

FEATURES (off the top of my head at approximately 2:30am)
* Saves to very easy to implement JSON
* Easily create branching narratives
* Easily add your own data to dialogue blocks 
* Spellcheck!
* A ton of other small things

As of right now, I'd say that this project is in early beta, and is good enough for quickly writing dialogue for small projects. Unfortunately, I haven't really done much in terms of tutorials and haven't really looked at the UI from the perspective of someone new to the software. Some features, such as spawning comment, branch, and title blocks, are only accessible through keyboard shortcuts - I aim to fix this somehow in the near future.
  
I'm trying my best to make the experience of writing dialogue in this thing as smooth and bug-free as possible, in the same way that honey bees try their best to not go extinct. Oh wait, they're going extinct.
