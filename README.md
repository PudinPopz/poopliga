the world's worst dialogue editor

This project started out as an experiment with Godot's UI system that went way too far. Initially, this was going to be a 2D level editor with a dialogue editor as a "bonus feature"; thus, the codebase (as well as platform of choice) carries many remnants of that fact. As the development of this project was primarily a learning experience, code quality ranges from questionable to violating the Geneva Conventions. The code for this project was made up of so much spaghetti that Benito Mussolini tried to impose increased import tariffs on it. It's horrible, but somehow still works *way* better than it has any right to.

Currently, you can create and edit dialogue blocks, hook them up to each other, and save/load your progress as a POOPLIGA file. There's a *teensy* bit more to it than that (you can also use these cool little title and comment blocks), but that's the gist of it. I guess it would be considered somewhat feature-complete at this stage; pretty much the only things missing are the ability to make branching dialogue, change the type of dialogue boxes at runtime (not every game is a sequel to [Jangnanmon](https://github.com/jaaamesey/jangnanmon)), play audio/sprite animations, as well as some other miscellaneous ease-of-use stuff. At some point I'll probably be rewriting this thing from scratch, likely as a web app or something. Those are pretty cool nowadays.
